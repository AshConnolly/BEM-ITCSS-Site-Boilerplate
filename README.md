# Site Boilerplate
Site Boilerplate (for IE 9 and upwards) utilizing the following principles:
* [Atomic Design](http://patternlab.io/)
* Object-oriented SCSS for modular development 
* [CSS guidelines](http://cssguidelin.es/) / [ITCSS](https://twitter.com/itcss_io) scss structure 
* Follows [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) to create clear CSS components but with less parent element name repetition and allowing low-level nesting. 

### Boilerplate features:
* Sass compilation
* CSS autoprefixer
* JS concatination
* Sass error catching to prevent watch task falling over
* Browsersync for faster development, easier multi browser / device testing
* Image compression
* Pre-set font size management
* Basic responsive grid
* Living style guide / patternlab

### Updates coming soon
* Basic accessibility guidelines
* Media query usage instructions
* Further elements / components to be added to style guide
* New grid system - susy / neat

Brad Frost's Atomic Design and Harry Robert's CSSGuidlines / ITCSS share the same fundamental approach - begin with simple elements / atoms and building up to complex groups of elements / molecules. This works in favor of the cascade and reduces CSS specificity issues.

###Further Reading
Harry Roberts and Brad Frost have strongly influenced the guidelines set out below and I highly recommend giving them a read.
